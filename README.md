# Google-search-results-scraper
Flask app for google search results scraping, with user input form for search query and downloadable .csv file output. Selects only organic results, search location is set to Czech Republic and number of results set to 10, the first page of results.
The app was intended to be deployed with zeet.co running on AWS Lambda, that was tested and worked well.
